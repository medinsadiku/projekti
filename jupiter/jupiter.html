            <h2>About Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System. Known for its Great Red Spot and numerous moons, Jupiter is a gas giant with a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined. It has a powerful magnetic field and is famous for its stormy atmosphere.Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. It contains trace elements like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon, ammonia, water vapour, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons.</p>
